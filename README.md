#Simple_shell
This is a group project for me and my friend
The project is written in C programming language.

#WHAT THE SHELL DOES
- Display a prompt and wait for user to type a command.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- If an executable cannot be found the shell prints an error message and displays prompt again.
- It also handle end files (ctr+D).
